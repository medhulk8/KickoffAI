TACTICAL KNOWLEDGE VALIDATION ✓ VERIFIED
================================================================================

Counter Relationships Verified:
✓ HIGH_PRESS countered by LOW_BLOCK ← Correct (can't press a deep block)
✓ HIGH_PRESS countered by PHYSICAL ← Correct (long balls bypass press)
✓ HIGH_PRESS effective vs POSSESSION ← Correct (forces errors)

✓ LOW_BLOCK countered by WING_PLAY ← Correct (stretches defense)
✓ LOW_BLOCK countered by SET_PIECES ← Correct (hard to break down otherwise)
✓ LOW_BLOCK effective vs HIGH_PRESS ← Correct (nullifies pressing)
✓ LOW_BLOCK effective vs POSSESSION ← Correct (compact shape)

✓ POSSESSION countered by COUNTER_ATTACK ← Correct (exploits space)
✓ POSSESSION countered by HIGH_PRESS ← Correct (forces errors)
✓ POSSESSION effective vs PHYSICAL ← Correct (bypasses physicality)

✓ COUNTER_ATTACK countered by LOW_BLOCK ← Correct (no space to exploit)
✓ COUNTER_ATTACK effective vs HIGH_PRESS ← Correct (exploits gaps)
✓ COUNTER_ATTACK effective vs POSSESSION ← Correct (hits on transition)

✓ WING_PLAY countered by PHYSICAL ← Correct (strong fullbacks)
✓ WING_PLAY effective vs LOW_BLOCK ← Correct (stretches defense)

✓ SET_PIECES countered by PHYSICAL ← Correct (height/strength)
✓ SET_PIECES effective vs LOW_BLOCK ← Correct (hard to break down)
✓ SET_PIECES effective vs TECHNICAL ← Correct (smaller teams)

INTEGRATION EXAMPLES ✓ DEMONSTRATED
================================================================================

Example 1: Match Prediction Enhancement
```python
matchup = kg.get_tactical_matchup("Liverpool", "Burnley")
tactical_score = len(matchup['advantages']['home']) - len(matchup['advantages']['away'])
# Use tactical_score as feature in ML model
```

Example 2: Agent Context
```python
tactical_context = kg.get_1hop_neighbors("Man City")
# Feed to agent for reasoning: {'styles': ['POSSESSION', 'TECHNICAL'], ...}
```

Example 3: Confidence Weighting
```python
matchup = kg.get_tactical_matchup("Arsenal", "Brighton")
confidence_weight = {'high': 1.0, 'medium': 0.6, 'low': 0.3}[matchup['confidence']]
# Weight predictions by tactical confidence
```
